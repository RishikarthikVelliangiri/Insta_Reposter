   - Fixed component syntax errors and nesting issues

2. **OAuth Authentication Integration**
   - Implemented Instagram OAuth flow in the frontend using React Router v6
   - Created backend API endpoints for authentication and token exchange
   - Added token storage mechanism for the Python script to use
   - Implemented status checking and logout functionality

3. **Backend Integration**

   - Added loading and error states during authentication
   - Improved UI for authenticated users

## Startup Scripts

Three startup scripts have been created to make running the application easier:

1. `start-dev.ps1` - Development mode startup with separate terminal windows
2. `start.ps1` - Production mode startup 
3. `start.bat` - Alternative batch file for Windows users

## Environment Configuration

1. Frontend (.env file):
```
REACT_APP_INSTAGRAM_APP_ID=your_app_id
REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

2. Backend (.env file):
```
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID=your_app_id
INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_secret
INSTAGRAM_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
PORT=5000
```

## Testing Instructions

1. Start both servers using one of the provided startup scripts
2. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000
3. Click "Login with Instagram" and follow the OAuth flow
4. After successful authentication, you can use the repost functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add more secure token storage options
   - Implement rate limiting and error handling

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add profile picture display and account information
   - Implement post history and user analytics
   - Improve error messages and feedback during OAuth flow

3. **Testing and Documentation**:
   - Conduct end-to-end testing with real Instagram accounts
   - Document API endpoints comprehensively
   - Create user guides for OAuth setup and usage
